Hi, I am Eden Ohr!
I have worked as a project coordinator (administration/analytics) and as a Creative Campaign Manager (Copywriter) in my professional work experience.
My mind is full of creative ideas and I have one that I am trying to bring to reality right now. 
Using the tools readily available to us such as YouTube, Google, etc. I am excited to see where this little trial project will take me.
Right now it November 28, 2023 and I know nothing about coding, let's see what happens next and how long it will take me.
Let's take this ride together!
